
Query 1:
    - before the index:
        Planning Time: 0.275 ms
        Execution Time: 89.675 ms
    - The indexes:
        CREATE INDEX idx_mission_date_year ON mission (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM mission_date));
    - after the index:
        Planning Time: 1.960 ms
        Execution Time: 7.952 ms
    - Explanation:
        The creation of the index idx_mission_date_year on the year extracted from mission_date
        significantly improved query performance by enabling faster
        filtering of missions for the specified year. The improved execution time indicates
        that the index effectively reduced the amount of data processed, leading to quicker
        access to relevant records.

    Query 2:
    - before the index:
        Planning Time: 1.127 ms
        Execution Time: 46.931 ms
    - The indexes:
        CREATE INDEX idx_mission_performance ON mission (airborne_aircraft, bomb_damage_assessment, target_country);
    - after the index:
        Planning Time: 1.662 ms
        Execution Time: 3.844 ms
    - Explanation:
        The index on the number of planes accelerated the filtering,
        and the index on the country improved the performance during the kibbutz.
